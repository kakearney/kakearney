### Hi there 👋
I'm Kelly Kearney, a research scientist who studies the impacts of climate on ocean ecosystems; most of my work involves the development and use of global and regional ocean and biogeochemical models.  I believe strongly that open development leads to better and more reproducible research, and strive to make all my research-related code available, primarily via this GitHub account.

## Current research

My current work at University of Washington/NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center looks at the impact of climate variability and change on Alaskan ecosystems, with a focus on the Bering Sea.  Head over to our [beringnpz](https://github.com/beringnpz) GitHub organization to find the code related to that, including:

- Our forks of [MOM6](https://github.com/beringnpz/MOM6) and [ROMS](https://github.com/beringnpz/roms)
- Our current [Bering Sea ROMS model applications](https://github.com/beringnpz/bering-Apps)
- My python-based [ROMS Communication Toolbox](https://github.com/beringnpz/romscom)

## Matlab utilities

Matlab is my high-level language of choice, and over the past two decades I've built a large library of small utilities; some are specific to the earth sciences and others (primarily plotting tools) are very generic.  Some of these tools (all identified by the -pkg suffix) are well-documented, others not as much (all .m files have appropriate in-file documentation, but I haven't added READMEs to all packages).  The fully-documented ones are co-shared on the [Matlab Central File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/870314)), and I'm slowly adding more as I find time.

I wanto add stats, but these are kinda misleading since they don't include the beringnpz organization account...
